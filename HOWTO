0. Suppose in your dev environment, you already set/install gcc, opengl/mesa, freeglut, glew and the most up-to-date graphics card driver. 
In my computer glew is installed in /usr/lib64, so I would set  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64 in my dev environment, especially for run-time.
1. Start from blank
Create a Eclipse CDT project, eg. a 'Hello World' project, preferrably a 'Cross GCC' project.
Right click the project, 'properties', select 'C/C++ Build', change 'Configuration' to <All configurations>.
'Settings', 'Cross GCC Linker', by 'Libraries(-l)' click the '+' sign to add 'Assembler flags' for the following (case sensitive):
<GLEW>
<GLU>
<GL>
<glut>
2. Copy the sources file into your 'src' folder. Create/copy the the 'shaders' folder. Create/copy the 'models' folder.
